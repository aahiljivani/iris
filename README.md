# Iris Classification Supervised ML

This project performs exploratory data analysis and classification on the famous Iris dataset using multiple machine learning algorithms. It serves as a comprehensive introduction to data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.

## 📊 Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic multivariate dataset that includes measurements for three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This analysis explores:

- Data distribution and relationships through visualization
- Model training using classification algorithms
- Performance comparison using accuracy and confusion matrices

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Checked for missing values and data types
   - Used pair plots and boxplots for visualization

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Encoded target labels
   - Feature scaling (if applicable)

3. **Model Training**
   - Trained Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN classifiers

4. **Evaluation**
   - Compared accuracy scores
   - Visualized confusion matrices

## 📈 Results

- The models performed with high accuracy; the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest score.
- Insights were drawn on feature importance and class separability.

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Add more classifiers (e.g., SVM, Gradient Boosting)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy using Streamlit for interactivity
